## Sports Noob

### Jeremy Kimball

### Pitch
Website with toggleable sports, showing latest news, latest scores, times of upcoming events. 
Presented in a manner catered to new fans of sports of their choosing.

### End User
Those interested but new to certain sports or those that want more digestible sports news. 

### Problem
If you are interested in a sport new to you, sometimes getting into it can be intimidating. 
Informational websites around the specific sport usually assume you are already familiar with all the rules, teams, players, coaches, histories, rivalries (etc)
### Features
Users on their account can toggle the sports they are interested in and receive news about upcoming events, latest news, and scores from previous events all aggregated on the home page. 
Or head to that sports specific page and see just it's information.
Simplified interface allowing for more digestible information as opposed to something like ESPN whose interface assumes intimate knowledge with the sports it presents.
A sports home page like hockey for example could have a quick news section, basically a TLDR for this past week in hockey. 
A section for some data displayed in an interesting way.
A page for each sport explaining the ins and outs in an easy to understand way, links to advanced topics.
Features could bend a bit depending on sport, as the information needed to be displayed may make sense for one sport but not another.

#### Example
Whoever runs the website could write a news post that would appear for people who have selected MMA as a sport they are interested in. The post would be about an upcoming fight card about why the fights are interesting, fun stylistic matchups, histories of the fighters, or implications for the future of the division. 
The end user who is interested in MMA but new to it, may now find the card more interesting with the added context, also would be provided with the additional information such as the time of the card (etc)


# Pros
* The idea's foundation is technically simple, page for each sport, show a post.
* Lots of room for additional functionality.
# Cons
* Heavily relies on content written for each sport. The website would need lots of posts written likely weekly.
* Target user is pretty niche.
