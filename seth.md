### Pitch
This app would be a place for users to log in and track movies they want to see and movies they have seen, as well as movie theaters they go to.
Users can leave reviews for both movies and theaters, and see the reviews other people have left, to make a more informed choice.

### End User
* This app targets moviegoers who like to check the reviews of movies and theaters before they commit to buying a ticket

### Problem
* Many people like to check the audience reviews of a movie before they go, and also like to ckeck google reviews of the theater itself. This app would group both of those in one place for convenience, along with information about the movies and theaters

### Features
* Pages for info about both movies and theaters
* Users and login to track the movies they have seen and theaters they have been to
* users can rate movies, see their individual ratings, and impact the overall rating of the movie
* users can also leave reviews of theaters
