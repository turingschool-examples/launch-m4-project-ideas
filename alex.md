## Library Specialist Hub

### Alex Bukhmirov

### Pitch
* The Library Hub will provide a place for Library Specialists to communicate and create content.
 It would include things like a weekly announcement board, a messaging board and perhaps a pet corner. 


### End User
* The target users are the Supporting Library Specialists of Arapagoe Libraries,
but if the app works out well there could be plans to spread the app throughout the library district.

### Problem
* The app is a way for the Library team to communicate more efficiently on one single app and with a easily customizable website.
* This app is different to other apps that are already in use, because it is tailor-made for the teams at Arapahoe Libraries and can be changed
 according to requests from the teams way easier than for example Microsoft Teams.

### Features
* Features can include: a announcement board, a messaging board, a pet corner, a team corner with photos and bios of the staff, login and authorization, and other features that the team might need.
