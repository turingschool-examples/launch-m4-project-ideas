### Pitch
* This is a web application designed for programmers to streamline their project management processes. It allows programmers
to create, organize, and manage projects efficiently, enabling them to break down projects into tasks, set deadlines, and track
progress.

### End User
* Developers/Engineers

### Problem
* My app is trying to make managing projects easier. I want the user to be able to add projects and create their own tasks.
Giving users the ability to seperate their projects in as many or little tasks as they want. 

### Features
* Project Creation/Organization
* Task Management per project
* Collaboration between multiple people in one project
* Progress tracking
* User Authentication/Authorization
