### Rafi Wick

### Pitch
My application will hold the statistical data from NBA games. It will be able to call both team and individual stats based on user requests as well as using it to calculate more advanced statistics. It will then be able to display the requested statistics in a user friendly and responsive UI.

### End User
The end user for my aplication is people that talk about basket ball and would like imperical evidence to back up their takes. It could also be used by people who want to inform their basketball opinions with statistics.

### Problem
* What problem is your app trying to solve? The problem being solved is that statistical data from a basketball game is dificult to look at and gleam meaning. To solve this my program will use algorithms to present the data as intuitive stats
* the feature that will set my project apart from other similar apps like statmuse is that you can set custom advanced stats that other services would not provide.

### Features
* User Features
* Display game box score w/ team and player data
* Display team aggregate stats (stat totals, avg stats, adv stats, home/away splits)
* Display player aggregate stats (stat totals, avg stats, adv stats, home/away splits)
* players/teams compare page
* Admin Fratures
* CRUD for Team, player, and game
* Set avilible aggregate stats (input some mathematical formula using stat data)
* Possibly an api connection to import real data at volume (sportradar)
