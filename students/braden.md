### Pitch
* This application will allow a user to create an account and keep track of media that they are currently watching, already watched, and want to watch. Additionally, a user can review media that they have seen with a comment and a rating out of 10. When browsing movies of all other users ratings and comments are visible with all movie information, the user that is browsing can also quick-add any movie to a ‘to watch’ list.

### End User
* The intended audience for this application would be frequent tv watchers - movies or tv shows. The most ideal audience would be avid watchers on streaming platforms that consume a lot of content that can review and validify the ratings. This application would be most beneficial for groups of connected people (friends, family, coworkers, etc.).

### Problem
* While not a major issue, sometimes I personally find it difficult to receive quality media recommendations, this application would not only allow me to have access to that but also have immediate information about the media (actor/actresses, #/10, honest comments). 
	* This application will be different from others - sites like ‘fandago’, ‘rottentomatos’, and others because this application is meant to be implemented with personal connections like friends, family, and even friends-of-friends.
	* Additionally, since the major sites have millions of users, the ratings become polluted by users creating several accounts, and obsessed fans overhyping, or over-hating and that being reflected in the reviews.
